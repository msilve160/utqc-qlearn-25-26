# qLearn: Quantum Computing Seminar Series 🧠⚛️

Welcome to the official repository for **qLearn**, a weekly student-led quantum computing seminar series hosted by the University of Toronto Quantum Computing Club (UTQC). This repo serves as a central hub for lecture slides, tutorial notebooks, and other learning materials shared during our sessions.

## 📚 About qLearn

qLearn is designed to make quantum computing accessible, engaging, and collaborative for students of all backgrounds. Each week, I present topics ranging from foundational quantum mechanics to cutting-edge quantum algorithms and hardware. Whether you're just starting out or diving deep into quantum research, there's something here for you.
